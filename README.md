# Nostalgic Counter

*[Êó•Êú¨Ë™ûÁâà„ÅØ„Åì„Å°„Çâ](README_ja.md)*

A nostalgic web counter service that brings back the 90s internet culture with modern technology. Remember those visitor counters that used to be on every personal homepage? Now you can add them to your site with just a few lines of code.

## ‚ú® Features

- üìä **Multiple time periods**: Total, today, yesterday, weekly, monthly statistics
- üö´ **No registration required**: Just provide a URL and secret token
- üîí **Duplicate prevention**: 24-hour cooldown per visitor
- üé® **3 nostalgic styles**: Classic (green on black), Modern (white on gray), Retro (yellow on purple)
- üåê **Easy embedding**: Web Components, direct images, or JavaScript fetch
- ‚ö° **Fast & reliable**: Built on Vercel with KV storage

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Get your counter ID

Paste this URL in your browser (replace with your site and secret token):

```
https://nostalgic-counter.vercel.app/api/count?url=https://yoursite.com&token=your-secret-token
```

The browser will show JSON with your public counter ID: `"id": "yoursite-a7b9c3d4"`

**Important**: The `url` parameter is just used as a **counter identifier**, not to track other people's websites. Each URL+token combination creates a separate counter that only you can manage with your secret token. Use different URLs for different pages if you want separate counters (e.g., `https://yoursite.com/blog`, `https://yoursite.com/about`).

*Note: This uses our hosted service. For self-hosting, see the [Service Options](#-service-options) section.*

**üí° Practice Mode**: You can click the example URL above to see how it works! It will create a demo counter that everyone can use for testing. Try management operations too:

```
https://nostalgic-counter.vercel.app/api/owner?action=set&url=https://yoursite.com&token=your-secret-token&total=12345
```

### 2. Choose your integration method

```

**Method A: Web Component (Recommended - All-in-one)**
```html
<script src="https://nostalgic-counter.vercel.app/components/counter.js"></script>
<nostalgic-counter id="yoursite-a7b9c3d4" type="total" style="classic"></nostalgic-counter>
```

**Method B: Direct Image (Display only)**
```html
<img src="https://nostalgic-counter.vercel.app/api/counter?id=yoursite-a7b9c3d4&type=total&style=classic" alt="Visitor Counter" />
```

**Method B + C: Custom Logic (Manual control)**
```javascript
// 1. Count the visit when you want
fetch('https://nostalgic-counter.vercel.app/api/count?id=yoursite-a7b9c3d4')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log('Current count:', data.total));

// 2. Display the counter image
<img src="https://nostalgic-counter.vercel.app/api/counter?id=yoursite-a7b9c3d4&type=total&style=classic" alt="Counter" />
```

That's it! Your counter will automatically count unique visitors and display the nostalgic counter image.
